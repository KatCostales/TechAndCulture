        No more excuses – our police can’t do their job 
        unless forces are cleaned up
    </h1>

                href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/police-suella-braverman-david-carrick-labour-b2408689.html">Article
                Link: Abuse of Power in Policing</a></div>

                Without confidence in policing, decent officers are fundamentally undermined, writes Jess Phillips. 
                We need proper strengthening of disciplinary and vetting practices
    </div>

    <div class="bodyText"> 
        Jess Philips’ article “No more excuses – our police can’t do their job unless forces are cleaned up” focuses on issues of corruption and injustice in the police system found in the UK. The arrest of David Carrick, an officer serving at the office of the author, sparked mixed emotions of guilt and shame in his former co-workers; as if they had committed the crime themselves. Philips calls for police reform and for those in higher power to take the next steps to ensure that the police force is a trustworthy and reliable group that citizens can rely on.
	
        As an American, police reform hits very close to home in many regions of our nation and in our own news outlets as a recurring issue. This article calls on Suella Braverman, the Home Secretary of the UK, to take the issue more seriously, as well as detailing the past inaction of the government in the issue. Philips works with victims of rape and assault and says that often they wait years to go to trial. Besides her personal connection with the victims, the article lacks any substance that would separate it from a normal person’s critique on the issue. Philips covers an important issue of corruption and fear, and yet only offers to criticize those in power without offering any solutions that are beyond the surface. The idea of reform and not allowing those with abusive tendencies are obvious. The author even mentions the movement of the government to bar those involved with abuse cases to serve on the force. She claims the government response to the issue is weak, but she lacks her own ideas of reform and change other than “we need to do better.”.
	
        Despite the lackluster take on the issue, the prevalence of the article is what is becoming a more prominent and emerging issue in the UK— that citizens do not trust their police force to deliver justice in the way that they are sworn to — especially when citizens are victims of crimes that those in the justice system are committing. It is distressing for all around those who choose to engage in those behaviors and should be something that their society evaluates and takes action against. People such as Braverman should be held accountable to uphold their position’s mission and do whatever is possible to stop injustice and instill trust in their police force again. From the American perspective, our country struggles and fails to address the issues of injustice. Depending on the severity of the issue in the UK, it would be good to look at where the US fails and reform before police brutality and abuse becomes as widespread as it is here
